[Notes on Rust and Cargo]

> Rust users rerfer to themselves as Rustaceans!

> If you include a [dependencies] section in a project's Cargo.toml file then
  cargo build will auto download and install the named dependencies! (including a defined
  version number).
  --> If, at a later date, the Crate is updated; the Cargo.lock file prevents any problems
      with backwards incompatability by 'locking' the version you are using unless you
      run cargo update. (NOTE: If you were on 0.3.0 before this will update to any 0.3.x
      release but will NOT update to 0.4.x without changing the listing in Cargo.toml)

> IDIOM: create a local scope 'shadow' of a current variable in order to do something with
         it without having to come up with endless new names for similar values.

> Rust has three levels of testing:
  --> Inline tests denoted with #[test]
  --> Including a test module via 'mod tests {#..test code..#}' headed with the
      #[cfg(test)] attribute.
  --> Doc tests to ensure that code examples in comments are valid: //! for module-level
      documentation and /// for function level documentation.
  NOTE: It is apparently also possible to have a testing directory for stand alone
        integration tests but I have yet to get this working.
